# Bacon_Code
The program encodes and decodes using Bacon's algorithm. 

It has 2 keys - alphabet which is used in secret that needs to be encoded and ab-key. Like this:

alphabet = 123

ab-group = aabba

1 = aaa

2 = abb

3 = bba

The secret encodes into random text. Symbols in text should be able to change register. Each 'a' makes lower case letter and 'b' - capital letter. Instance:

secret = 23

text = Hello, you!

Coded secret = hELLO, you!

PS This code shouldn't  be written using OOP but wanted to practice.
